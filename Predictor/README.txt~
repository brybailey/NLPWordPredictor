This program was designed and built as the final project for our Natuaral Langauge Processing course at Williams College
taught in Fall 2016 by visiting Professor Johan Boye. 

@authors: Braden Becker '19 and Bryan Bailey '19
@language: Java
@init_class: GUI.java

The program is run through the GUI.java file with the following flags determining project functioning:
java GUI -n <number> (2,3,4) -v <number> (2,3)

the -n flag will determine the n-gram level, and the v-flag will determine the viterbi decoding level
if no arguments are given, the program will initialize to a bigram model for both prediction and decoding
